# arguments:
# -1: folder name where the repo is
# -2 (optional): considered file we are interested in. If missing, all files will be "diffed"
#
# output will be in /tmp/gitdiff, two files per branch, a raw diff and a html version

# dependencies:
# - colordiff
# - aha (https://github.com/theZiz/aha)
